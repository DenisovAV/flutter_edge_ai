# GitHub Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD automation.

## Workflows

### 🧪 [`test.yml`](workflows/test.yml) - CI Tests
Runs on every push/PR to `main` or `develop`:
- ✅ Code analysis (`flutter analyze`)
- ✅ Unit tests with coverage
- ✅ Android example APK build
- ✅ iOS example build (unsigned)

**Status:** [![CI Tests](https://github.com/DenisovAV/flutter_edge_ai/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DenisovAV/flutter_edge_ai/actions/workflows/test.yml)

---

### 🚀 [`release.yml`](workflows/release.yml) - Release Build
Runs when you push a tag `v*.*.*`:
- ✅ Builds release APK
- ✅ Creates GitHub Release
- ✅ Attaches APK to release
- ✅ Auto-generates release notes

**Status:** [![Release Build](https://github.com/DenisovAV/flutter_edge_ai/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DenisovAV/flutter_edge_ai/actions/workflows/release.yml)

git add pubspec.yaml CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Bump version to 0.11.8"
git push origin main

git tag v0.11.8
git push origin v0.11.8

# 4. GitHub Actions will automatically:
#    - Build APK
#    - Create release
#    - Attach APK
```

### Run Tests Locally

```bash
# All tests
flutter test

# With coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Specific test file
flutter test test/core/model_source_test.dart
```
